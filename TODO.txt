For the final release:

- Replace the blinking dots in the intro part with textures
  (because few phones can render smoothed points)

- Fix the scroller's shadow (there are stripes from the line rendering)

- Optimize the credits part / fix the alignment of the cubes

- Add the tunnel / camera texture "hidden" part

- Print some greetings to the debug console

- Use wrapped "direct" ByteBuffers for rendering

- Use a sin/cos table
